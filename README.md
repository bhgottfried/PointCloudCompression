# PointCloudCompression

Implementation of point cloud compression algorithm designed here:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6224647

This repository will attempt to implement this algorithm in the following three ways and
compare the resulting performance numbers of each: Single-threaded C-elision,
Multi-threaded C-elision, and GPU-based CUDA variant.

This repository is built by Ben Gottfried and Kirshanthan Sundararajah, working under Milind Kulkarni, Purdue University.
